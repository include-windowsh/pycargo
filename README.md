# pycargo
This is a package manger for python

Create new poject use "pycargo new [your poject name]" ('_')

Run your poject use "pycargo run"(must in your python poject dir)(` - `)

if you want build your poject to execute:
  first: install [pyinstaller] use "pip install pyinstaller"
  second: in your python poject run "pycargo build"
the execute will in poject dir

it's the as same as rust's "cargo", but it isn't perfect:(. have a fun :)
